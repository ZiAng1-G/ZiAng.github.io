Hi there, Iâ€™m currently a second year undergraduate researcher at Michigan State University. I am fortunate enough to work under the guidance of [Dr. Feng liu](https://liufeng2915.github.io) and [Prof. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html) in MSU CVLab! During the summer of 2023, I work as a research assistant at MSU CVLab in the ENSURE program, where I try to improve the controllability of the large diffusion models on sence level 3d generation.

My research focuses on 3D object/scene understanding, including 3d generation, 3d body reconstruction, and 3d recognition. For more details, please check my [publication section](https://zianggu1.github.io/publications/)!
