Hi there, Iâ€™m currently a second year undergraduate researcher at Michigan State University. I am fortunate enough to work under the guidance of [Dr. Feng Liu](https://liufeng2915.github.io) and [Prof. Xiaoming Liu](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html) in MSU CVLab! During the summer of 2023, I work as a summer research intern at MSU CVLab in the ENSURE program, where I try to improve the controllability of the large diffusion models on scene level text to 3d generation.

My research focuses on 3D object/scene understanding, including 3D generation, 3D body reconstruction, and 3D recognition. I am also interested in adding control to large generative models. For more details, please check my [publication section](https://zianggu1.github.io/publications/)!  


Summer 2024 Internship Opportunity
======
I am looking for internship/REUs in the field of computer vision, machine learning, NLP, or related fields. 

If you have anything you would like to discuss with me, plz send me an email to guziang@msu.edu
